# EV-Power-Consumption-Prediction-Model

I have first created a fast charging EV battery model on MATLAB Simulink and used the output dataset to predict Energy Consumption through Gradient Boost Regressor and CatBoost.
Further I have innovated the model using Solar energy and made it more sustainable. Then I have used deep learning techniques like MLP and LSTM to further create my prediction model. The results are good and insights are useful.
